# Outlier Detection for a 2D Feature Space in Python

This project contains all files related to the Medium article "Outlier Detection for a 2D Feature Space in Python: How to detect outliers using plotting and clustering techniques to analyze the dependency of two features". 

## Motivation
This project is showing some basics steps in how to visualize and detect outliers in a two-dimensional feature space, meaning a dependency between two features.

## Folder structure
- `./datasets`: Contains the input dataset for the used algorithms and the outcome dataset of the outlier detection.
- `./algorithms` : Contains the algorithms to visualize and detect outliers in a 2D feature space, including an unsupervised machine learning model to cluster data.

## Environment
The project was developed in the IDE PyCharm with the Project Interpreter Python 3.7.

### Used frameworks include
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
